This entire route falls inside Shimla\u2019s official Heritage Zone, where every step connects you to the town\u2019s past and its stunning Himalayan setting. During this walk, you\u2019ll explore how Shimla grew from a small hill settlement into a charming mountain town filled with Victorian and post-Victorian architecture. The experience is as much about the scenery as it is about history quiet forested stretches, long views of the southern hills, and glimpses of the high northern mountains. \nSome of the most iconic buildings along the walk include Christ Church, the Gaiety Theatre, the old Bandstand, heritage hotels, early banks, and former government offices. These landmarks are among the finest examples of colonial era architecture in India and each carries stories of the people and moments that shaped Shimla\u2019s unique character.\nDesigned originally as a curated introduction to the town, the Heritage Walk has grown into one of the most loved ways for visitors from around the world to get to know Shimla  gently, slowly, and with a sense of place. It ends at Vice Regal Lodge which itself is a national heritage and perfect place to slow down, journal, sketch and learn the architectural nuances.
